OAuth Buddy
===========

OAuth 1.0A header generator. I wrote it (and then extracted) for Twitter API v.1.1 wrapper that I use in some old and kinda big Rails app. The problem was that there were numbers of customized gems and I didn't want to make it worse by adding another one (possible dependency conflict).

A few obvious things to be tested. It should work, though :paste the second part of MIT licence preamble here:. Maybe it could serve as learning materials.
